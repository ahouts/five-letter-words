# five-letter-words

A solution to the problem posed in
[Can you find: five five-letter words with twenty-five unique letters?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w)

Single threaded, fairly straightforward implementation that runs in under 30 seconds on my system.
Five nested for loops, completes in a reasonable amount of time because:

1. it uses `continue` if the current word conflicts with the other words we have chosen
2. in each for loop use `i+1` as the starting index, where `i` is the index of the outer for loop

I think this means no duplicate work is done, but I could be wrong.
